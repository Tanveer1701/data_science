    "Q5. What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "Ans-Inheritance allows us to create a new class by inheriting the attributes and methods of an existing class. The new class is called the subclass, and the existing class is called the superclass.\n",
    "   Inheritance promotes code reuse and helps to avoid code duplication.\n",
