A positive covariance indicates that the two variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance indicates that one variable tends to increase as the other decreases. However, covariance does not provide information about the strength or direction of the relationship, and the magnitude of the covariance depends on the scale of the variables.\n",

    "Q14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.\n",
    "ans-Measures of central tendency, such as the mean and median, can be greatly affected by outliers. The mean is particularly sensitive to outliers, as it takes into account every value in the dataset. If there are one or more extreme values in the dataset, the mean will be pulled in the direction of the outliers, potentially skewing the entire distribution. The median, on the other hand, is less affected by outliers, as it is only influenced by the values at the center of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of dispersion, such as the range, variance, and standard deviation, can also be affected by outliers. If there are one or more extreme values in the dataset, the range will be much larger than it would be without the outliers. Similarly, the variance and standard deviation will be inflated, as these measures are based on the distance of each value from the mean. If there are one or more extreme values, they will contribute more to the variance and standard deviation, leading to an overestimate of the true variability of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a dataset of salaries at a company that includes an outlier for a CEO who earns significantly more than the other employees. The mean salary will be much higher than the median salary, as the CEO's salary is pulling the mean up. The range, variance, and standard deviation will also be much larger than they would be without the CEO's salary, as this extreme value is far from the rest of the data. In this case, it may be more appropriate to use the median or other robust measures of central tendency and dispersion that are less influenced by outliers."
