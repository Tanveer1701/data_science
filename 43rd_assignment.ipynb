    "Q1. Describe the decision tree classifier algorithm and how it works to make predictions.\n",
    "ans-The decision tree classifier is a supervised learning algorithm that is used for both classification and regression tasks. The algorithm builds a tree-like structure where each node represents a feature or attribute, and each branch represents a possible value for that feature. The leaves of the tree represent the target variable or the class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm works by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on the values of the features that provide the maximum information gain or the highest decrease in impurity. This process is repeated until the subsets are pure, meaning that all the instances in each subset belong to the same class or have the same target variable value."

    "The mathematical intuition behind the decision tree classification algorithm can be explained in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the impurity of the dataset: To build the decision tree, we need to determine which features are the most important in classifying the data. The first step is to calculate the impurity of the dataset. This can be done using metrics such as entropy or Gini impurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the feature with the highest information gain: Once we have calculated the impurity of the dataset, we need to determine which feature to split on. We do this by calculating the information gain of each feature, which is the difference between the impurity of the parent node and the weighted average of the impurities of the child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Split the dataset based on the selected feature: After choosing the feature with the highest information gain, we split the dataset based on the possible values of that feature. For example, if we are classifying whether a fruit is an apple or an orange based on its color and size, we may split the dataset into subsets based on whether the fruit is red or green, and whether it is small or large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeat the process recursively: We continue to split the dataset on the feature with the highest information gain, and create new nodes and branches in the tree until all the data is classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign class labels to the leaf nodes: Once the tree is built, we assign class labels to the leaf nodes based on the majority class of the data that falls into that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make predictions: To make a prediction on new data, we traverse the decision tree by starting at the root node and following the branches based on the feature values of the input data, until we reach a leaf node with a class label.\n",
