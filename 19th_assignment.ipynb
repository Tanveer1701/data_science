    "#Q1. Explain GET and POST methods.\n",
    "ans-The GET method is used to request data from the server. When a client sends a GET request, the server retrieves the specified resource and sends it back to the client in the response body. This method is typically used for retrieving data, such as web pages, images, and other resources. The data is sent as part of the URL in the form of a query string.\n",
    "The POST method is used to send data to the server to create or update a resource. When a client sends a POST request, the server processes the data in the request body and creates or updates the specified resource. This method is typically used for submitting forms, uploading files, and other actions that modify data on the server."

    "ans-In Flask, the redirect() function is used to redirect the user to a different URL or route. When a user makes a request to a Flask application, the server processes the request and generates a response. By using the redirect() function, the server can send a special response to the client that instructs it to make a new request to a different URL.\n"
