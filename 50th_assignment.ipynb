    "Efficiency: K-means is computationally efficient and can handle large datasets with a moderate number of clusters.\n",
    "Scalability: K-means can scale well with the number of data points and features.\n",
    "Interpretability: The resulting clusters in K-means can be easily interpreted and analyzed due to their centroid-based representation.\n",
    "Suitability for Numeric Data: K-means works well with numeric data and Euclidean distance as the similarity metric.\n",

While there is no definitive method to determine the exact optimal number of clusters, several techniques can help in the decision-making process. Here are some common methods:\n",

For each data point, it calculates the average distance to other points within the same cluster (a) and the average distance to points in the nearest neighboring cluster (b). The silhouette coefficient (ranging from -1 to 1) is then computed as (b - a) / max(a, b). Higher silhouette coefficients indicate better-defined clusters.
