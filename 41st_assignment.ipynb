    "Q1. What is the purpose of grid search cv in machine learning, and how does it work?\n",
    "ans-The purpose of grid search cross-validation (CV) in machine learning is to find the optimal hyperparameters for a given model.\n",
    "Grid search CV works by exhaustively searching over a specified range of hyperparameter values to find the optimal combination that results in the best performance metric on a validation set. The grid search algorithm builds and evaluates a model for each combination of hyperparameters, then returns the combination that produces the best performance."

    "ans-Grid search CV and randomized search CV are two common methods for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning\n",
    "Grid search CV involves exhaustively searching over a pre-defined range of hyperparameter values to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters. It builds a model for every combination of hyperparameters specified in the grid, which can be time-consuming and computationally expensive. Grid search CV is suitable when the number of hyperparameters to tune is small, and the possible values for each hyperparameter are well defined.\n",
    "On the other hand, randomized search CV selects hyperparameters randomly from a specified distribution of possible values. This approach covers a wider range of hyperparameter values than grid search CV and can help to discover better hyperparameters faster than grid search CV. Randomized search CV is suitable when the number of hyperparameters to tune is large, and the possible values for each hyperparameter are not well defined."

False positives occur when the model predicts a positive result when the actual result is negative. False negatives occur when the model predicts a negative result when the actual result is positive. By analyzing these cases, we can identify potential biases or limitations in the model, such as data quality issues, data preprocessing errors, or algorithmic limitations."
