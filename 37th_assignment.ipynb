    "ans-Overfitting and underfitting are common problems in machine learning that occur when a model is too complex or too simple, respectively, for the data it is being trained on.\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and is able to fit the training data too well, capturing noise and random fluctuations in the data rather than the underlying patterns. The consequence of overfitting is that the model may perform poorly on new, unseen data, as it has essentially memorized the training data rather than learned the general patterns.\n",

    "Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and is unable to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The consequence of underfitting is that the model will perform poorly on both the training data and new, unseen data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Regularization: Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that the model is trying to minimize during training. This penalty term discourages the model from fitting the noise in the data and encourages it to learn more general patterns.\n",

In other words, variance is the amount that the model's predictions vary for different training sets.
