    "SQL and NoSQL are two types of database management systems that differ in their approach to data storage and retrieval.\n",
    "QL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that store data in tables with predefined columns and data types. SQL databases use the SQL language to manipulate data and execute queries.\n",
    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that do not use the traditional table-based data storage model. Instead, NoSQL databases use various data models such as document-based, key-value, graph, and column-family models. "
