    "The Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through several mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Subsampling: Random Forest Regressor uses a technique called bagging, which involves creating an ensemble of decision trees trained on different subsets of the training data. Each tree is built using a random subset of the data, selected through sampling with replacement. This random subsampling helps to reduce the impact of outliers and noisy data points, making the model more robust and less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Feature Selection: In addition to random subsampling of the data, Random Forest Regressor also performs random feature selection at each split when constructing the decision trees. Instead of considering all features at each split, only a random subset of features is considered. This further introduces randomness and reduces the likelihood of individual trees relying too heavily on a specific set of features. By diversifying the features used in the trees, the model becomes less sensitive to irrelevant or noisy features, reducing overfitting."

    "Q3. How does Random Forest Regressor aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees?\n",

Each decision tree in the Random Forest independently makes predictions for a given input, and the final prediction is obtained by averaging the predictions of all the trees."

    "\n",
    "n_estimators: It specifies the number of decision trees in the random forest. Increasing the number of trees can improve the model's performance, but it also increases computation time. The default value is 100.\n",

    "max_features: It determines the maximum number of features to consider for each split when building the decision trees. The available options include:\n",

    "\"auto\" or \"sqrt\": It considers the square root of the total number of features.\n",
    "\"log2\": It considers the logarithm base 2 of the total number of features.\n",
    "None: It considers all the features.\n",
    "An integer value: It considers a fixed number of features.\n",
    "max_depth: It specifies the maximum depth of the decision trees. Restricting the tree depth can help prevent overfitting. If set to None, the trees will grow until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples."

    "ans-The main difference between the Random Forest Regressor and the Decision Tree Regressor lies in their underlying models and the way they make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Structure: The Decision Tree Regressor consists of a single decision tree, whereas the Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble of multiple decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Process: The Decision Tree Regressor is trained by recursively splitting the data based on the features to minimize the impurity or variance, resulting in a single tree structure. On the other hand, the Random Forest Regressor creates an ensemble of decision trees using a technique called bagging. Each tree in the ensemble is trained on a random subset of the data and a random subset of features, making them independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction Process: In the Decision Tree Regressor, the prediction is made by traversing down the tree structure based on the feature values of the input instance and determining the leaf node, which provides the predicted value. In the Random Forest Regressor, the prediction is obtained by aggregating the predictions from all the individual decision trees. Typically, the average of the predictions from all the trees is taken as the final prediction."
