    "The open() function takes two arguments: the file name or path, and the mode in which the file should be opened\n",
    "Here are the different modes of opening a file in Python, along with a brief explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "r (read mode): Opens a file for reading (default mode). If the file does not exist, a FileNotFoundError is raised.\n",
    "w (write mode): Opens a file for writing. If the file does not exist, it is created. If the file exists, it is truncated (i.e., all contents are deleted).\n",
    "x (exclusive creation mode): Opens a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, a FileExistsError is raised.\n",
    "a (append mode): Opens a file for appending data. If the file does not exist, it is created. If the file exists, new data is written to the end of the file.\n",
    "b (binary mode): Opens a file in binary mode, which is used for non-text files such as images or executable files.\n",

    "#Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "ans-The reason for this is that when you open a file, the operating system allocates system resources (such as memory or file descriptors) to the file, and these resources remain allocated until the file is closed. If you don't close the file, these resources can become exhausted, which can cause errors or performance problems in your program."
